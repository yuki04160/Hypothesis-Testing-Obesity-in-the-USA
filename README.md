# Hypothesis Testing - Obesity in the USA
## Introduction
To examine the previous research findings and to use data from a random sample to make inferences about the BMI and obesity of a population (USA), I conducted One-sample t-test, Two proportion z-test, F-test, and Two-sample t-test in R using Kaggle dataset - [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance#insurance.csv).
## Steps in Hypothesis Testing
1. Assumption checking
2. Define the Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis
3. Inferential statistical analysis
   - Hypothesis test graphs
   - Critical value & Test statistic
   - Significance level & P-value
## Conclusion
Overall, different kinds of hypothesis tests were used to answer questions and graphs were helpful to summarize results and provide more insights into data.

1. <strong>One-sample t-test</strong> was used to establish that the average BMI in the United States is greater than 30, which considered the obesity threshold.
2. <strong>Two proportion z-test</strong> was used to conclude that the proportion of obesity in the southeast is higher than the proportion of obesity in the northwest, which is identical to previous research.
3. <strong>F-test</strong> was used to examine the variances of the two populations (BMI of smokers/ BMI of non-smokers).
4. <strong>Two-sample t-test</strong> was used to establish that there is not enough evidence to prove the negative relationship between cigarette consumption and BMI.
