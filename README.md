# Hypothesis Testing - Obesity in the USA
## Introduction
To examine the previous research findings and to use data from a random sample to make inferences about a population, I conducted One-sample t-test, Two proportion z-test, F-test, and Two-sample t-test in R using Kaggle dataset - [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance#insurance.csv).
## Steps in Hypothesis Testing
1. Assumption checking
2. Define the Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis
3. Inferential statistical analysis
   - Critical value & Test statistic
   - Significance level & P-value
## Conclusion
1. One-sample t-test was used to establish that the average BMI in the United States is greater than 30, which considered the obesity threshold.
2. Two proportion z-test was used to conclude that the proportion of obesity in the southeast is higher than the proportion of obesity in the northwest, which is identical to previous research.
3. F-test was used to examine the variances of the two populations (BMI of smokers/ BMI of non-smokers).
4. Two-sample t-test was used to establish that there is not enough evidence to prove the negative relationship between cigarette consumption and BMI.
Overall, different kinds of hypothesis tests were used to answer questions and graphs were helpful to summarize results and provide more insights into data.
